When the built-in delta factory constructors do not cover your use case, implement the delta class directly and override
`call`. Suppose you want to mirror a widget's EdgeInsets padding. To do so, implement `EdgeInsetsDelta` with a `call`
method that swaps the edges:

<CodeSnippet snippet={implementSnippet} />

Pass it anywhere an `EdgeInsetsDelta` is accepted:

<CodeSnippet snippet={usageSnippet} />

The same pattern works for any delta class. Implement it and override call.
