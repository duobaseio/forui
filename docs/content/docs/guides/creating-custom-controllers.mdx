title: Creating Custom Controllers
description: Extend Forui controllers with custom logic and pass them to widgets.

import { CodeSnippet } from '@/components/code-snippet/code-snippet';
import customManagedSnippet from '@/snippets/snippets/guides/creating_custom_controllers/custom_managed.json';
import extendManagedSnippet from '@/snippets/snippets/guides/creating_custom_controllers/extend_managed.json';

Suppose you extend a controller, e.g. `FPopoverController`, to add custom logic. You have **2** options when passing the
custom controller to a widget.

## Managed Control with External Controller

Pass the custom controller via a managed control.

<CodeSnippet snippet={customManagedSnippet} />

The downside of this approach is that you have to manage the controller's lifecycle yourself.

## Extend Managed Control

Alternatively, you can extend managed control (`FPopoverManagedControl`) to create your custom controller.

<CodeSnippet snippet={extendManagedSnippet} />

This way, the widget manages the controller's lifecycle for you.
