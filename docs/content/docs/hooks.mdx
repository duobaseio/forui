Forui provides first class integration with [Flutter Hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks). All controllers
are exposed as hooks in the companion `forui_hooks` package.

## Installation

From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to install `flutter_hooks` and `forui_hooks`.

```bash filename="bash" copy
flutter pub add flutter_hooks
flutter pub add forui_hooks
```

## Usage

To use Forui hooks in your Flutter app, import the `forui_hooks` package and initialize a hook inside a `HookWidget`.
